# RYDynamicFontSize
Used to adjust font size of anything including the texts as per device size

### Scenario:
iPhones are of different sizes viz. iPhone 5,6,XS,XS Max etc..  
Through Autolayout, we can adjust size of views as per the current device size. But in case of texts, autolayout doesn't help.
Through a simple macro, we can adjust the font sizes(or anything) automatically without checking the device size programatically.  
  
### Example:
